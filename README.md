# The JOSM Streets plugin, powered by osm2streets

The JOSM Streets plugin aims to bring the power of [osm2streets](https://github.com/a-b-street/osm2streets) to JOSM.

## Building

You need a copy of the JOSM core source in order to build the plugin. Get a copy of the source, then checkout this code into the `plugins/` dir. Then run the gradle `runJosm` task.

See https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/DevelopersGuide/DevelopingPlugins#BuildingJOSMcore

The build setup is has been cobbled together with no deep understanding of the ecosystem, so any suggested improvements are very welcome!
